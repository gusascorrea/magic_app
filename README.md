# Magic Formula and Value Investing Dashboard

This dashboard application provides insights and tools for implementing the Magic Formula and Value Investing strategy. The Magic Formula, developed by Joel Greenblatt, selects stocks based on high Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Earnings Yield, representing quality and value, respectively, measured by accounting-based indicators for companies.

## Overview
The dashboard consists of three main panels:

1. **Magic Formula and Value Investing**: Provides an explanation of the strategy along with visual representations of annual returns, volatility, and performance data.
2. **List of Stocks**: Allows users to select a strategy (Earnings Yield, Magic Formula, or ROIC), specify the number of stocks in the portfolio, investment amount, and liquidity filter. It then displays a list of recommended stocks based on the chosen strategy.

## Usage
To use the dashboard:

1. Choose your preferred language (English or Portuguese) from the sidebar.
2. Navigate through the different panels using the sidebar options.
